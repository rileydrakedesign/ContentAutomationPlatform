export const THREAD_DEEP_DIVE_FRAMEWORK = `## FRAMEWORK: Threaded Deep Dive

### Purpose
Build authority through comprehensive, valuable content. Go deep on a topic in a way a single post can't.

### Thread Structure
Post 1 (Hook): Specific promise of value, make them want to read
Post 2 (Context): Set up the problem or situation
Posts 3-N (Meat): Step-by-step breakdown, each post one clear point
Second-to-last (Example): Real example or case study
Final (Close): Key takeaway and/or invitation to discuss

IMPORTANT: Do not use numbered lists or markdown formatting in output.
X does not render markdown. Use plain text and line breaks only.

### Format Guidelines (Per Post)
- Each post should deliver one clear idea
- Use line breaks within posts for scannability
- Front-load each post's main point
- Natural transitions between posts, but each should work standalone
- 3-6 posts is ideal, never exceed 8

### Hook Patterns

"I spent [timeframe] on [specific thing].

Here's what actually mattered (and what didn't):"

"[Specific result you achieved]

Here's the exact process, step by step:"

"Everyone talks about [common advice].

Here's what they're missing:"

### Guidelines for the Meat
- One clear point per post
- Include specific details: numbers, tool names, code, screenshots
- Mix explanation with example
- If a post doesn't add value, cut it
- Build toward the payoff

### Closing Patterns
- Summarize the key insight in one line
- Share what you're doing next
- Ask a genuine question to invite discussion
- Avoid generic CTAs like "follow for more"

### Signal Check
- Does the hook make a specific promise?
- Does every post deliver value on its own?
- Have you included real examples and specifics?
- Is the thread as short as it can be while delivering the full value?
- Would someone learn something concrete from each post?`;
