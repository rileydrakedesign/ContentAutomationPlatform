export const TACTICAL_GUIDE_FRAMEWORK = `## FRAMEWORK: Tactical Mini-Guide

### Purpose
Create save-worthy educational content. Practical, actionable, immediately useful.

### Structure
1. Problem statement (what this solves)
2. The approach or steps (the meat)
3. Why it works or what result you got
4. Optional: caveat or "when not to use this"

### Format Guidelines
- Use clear visual separation between problem and solution
- Number steps if sequential, bullets if not
- Each step should be one clear action
- Expand on non-obvious steps, skip obvious ones
- Line breaks between logical sections

### Pattern Examples

Compact:
"If you're struggling with [problem], try this:

[Step or rule]

[Step or rule]

[Step or rule]

This helped me [specific result]."

Expanded:
"[Problem statement that resonates]

Here's what's working for me:

First, [step with brief explanation of why]

Then, [step with brief explanation]

Finally, [step with brief explanation]

Result: [specific outcome with numbers if possible]

Note: [when this doesn't apply or caveat]"

IMPORTANT: Do not use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) or markdown formatting.
Use line breaks and plain text only. X does not render markdown.

### Guidelines
- Start with a problem people actually have
- Keep steps concrete and actionable (not vague advice)
- 2-5 steps for single posts, more for threads
- Include your actual result if possible
- Use simple language, not jargon

### Signal Check
- Is each step something someone can do right now?
- Are you sharing from experience, not theory?
- Have you cut steps that are obvious?
- Is the result concrete and believable?`;
