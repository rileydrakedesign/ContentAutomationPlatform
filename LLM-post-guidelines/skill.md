## Workflow

### For Writing New Content

1. **Understand the goal**: What's the user trying to achieve? (promote video, share workflow, drive engagement)
2. **Read relevant references**: 
   - Always read `copywriting-principles.md` for Twitter-specific tactics
   - Optionally read `engagement-templates.md` if using proven frameworks
   - Optionally read `high-performing-examples.md` for inspiration
3. **Draft multiple hook options**: Create 3-5 different opening lines
4. **Apply principles**: Use direct reader targeting, lead with benefits, avoid overused patterns
5. **Format for platform**: Consider character limits, above-the-fold preview (especially LinkedIn)
6. **Include clear CTA**: Make the next action obvious

### For Editing Existing Content

1. **Read the original**: Understand the intent and current approach
2. **Check against principles**: Read `copywriting-principles.md` and `feedback-examples.md`
3. **Identify issues**:
   - Weak or generic hook?
   - Burying the benefit?
   - Using overused patterns ("Most creators...", "Everyone is...")?
   - Unclear CTA?
   - Poor formatting for skimmers?
4. **Create improved version**: Apply specific fixes with rationale
5. **Explain changes**: Reference principles used in the improvements

### For Analysis Tasks

1. **Read relevant references**: Especially `high-performing-examples.md` and `copywriting-principles.md`
2. **Identify patterns**: What makes the examples work?
3. **Extract insights**: Specific, actionable takeaways
4. **Provide context**: How to apply these patterns

## Key Principles Summary

**Hook Fundamentals:**
- Target the reader directly ("You can make $2k" > "Web designers are making $2k")
- Lead with benefit first
- Avoid overused patterns ("Most creators...", "Everyone is...")
- Start with strong claims (big numbers, surprising insights)

**Content Structure:**
- One clear idea per tweet
- Use bullet points for readability
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- End with clear CTA

**Engagement Triggers:**
- Social proof ($31K made, 100k followers)
- Urgency/scarcity (Free for 24hrs)
- Low friction (No email bs, Just comment X)
- Exclusive access (I'll DM you the guide)

**Avoid These Mistakes:**
- Burying the lead
- Being too humble ("This might help")
- Overcomplicating
- Forgetting the reader's needs
- Weak endings

## Platform-Specific Notes

**Twitter/X:**
- First 280 characters are critical
- Thread starters should hook immediately
- CTAs for engagement work well

**LinkedIn:**
- First 2-3 lines show in feed preview
- Professional but conversational tone
- Longer form acceptable but frontload value

## Reference File Loading Strategy

- **Always read** `copywriting-principles.md` for Twitter tasks
- **Read when editing** `feedback-examples.md` to see practical applications
- **Read for inspiration** `high-performing-examples.md` to understand viral patterns
- **Read for frameworks** `engagement-templates.md` when using proven templates
- **Read for foundations** `writing-principles.md` for general writing improvement

Start with the most relevant reference file(s) for the specific task, then expand as needed.
