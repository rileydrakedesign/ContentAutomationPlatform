# Writing Principles

Fundamental principles for clear, engaging, and effective writing across all content types.

## 1. Have Something Worth Saying

- A good idea beats perfect grammar
- No amount of skill can rescue a boring message
- Strong writing starts with strong thinking
- Think, research, and bring fresh insight

## 2. Know the Audience

- Don't just collect facts—understand what they care about
- Read comments. Listen to how they speak
- Know their problems better than they do

## 3. Define the Purpose

- What's the goal? Inform, persuade, entertain, sell?
- Purpose makes each sentence count
- No purpose = wasted words

## 4. Write Conversationally

- Like talking to a friend, not writing a dissertation
- Use contractions, questions, "you," and casual flow
- Formal = distant. Conversational = engaging

## 5. Keep it Simple

- Simple ≠ dumb
- Fewer, sharper sentences win
- The goal is frictionless idea transfer

## 6. Open Strong

- Your first sentence matters most
- Start with curiosity, value, or a surprise
- Hook them immediately or lose them

## 7. Use Active Voice

- Subject → verb → object
- "The kid hit the ball" > "The ball was hit by the kid"
- Clear structure = better comprehension

## 8. One Idea per Unit

- One idea per sentence. One topic per paragraph
- Make things easy to follow
- Readers are easily distracted—don't overload them

## 9. Format for Skimmers

- Most people skim
- Use short paragraphs, bullets, bold text, numbers, white space
- Visuals help people stick around

## 10. Be Concrete

- Specific > abstract
- "Cut meetings from 2 hours to 30 mins" is better than "improve efficiency"
- Paint a clear picture

## 11. Use Stories & Emotion

- Facts inform, stories stick
- Emotion + logic = memorable
- Be vulnerable. Show success *and* failure

## 12. Show, Don't Just Tell

- "She slammed the door" > "She was angry"
- Use showing for emotion, telling for clarity when needed

## 13. Structure for Clarity

- Use "Tell them what you'll say > Say it > Recap it"
- Reinforce with structure
- People need scaffolding

## 14. Vary Sentence Length

- Long sentences build momentum
- Short sentences hit hard
- Rhythm keeps readers engaged

## 15. Use Transitions

- Breadcrumbs guide the reader: "However," "For example," "Meanwhile"
- They make logic seamless

## 16. Cut Ruthlessly

- Delete fluff. Replace weak words
- Don't write "very happy" when "ecstatic" works
- The second draft is where clarity happens

## 17. Read It Out Loud

- If it sounds wrong, it reads wrong
- Listen for awkward flow or long sentences

## 18. Write for the Reader

- Think about *their* needs, not your knowledge
- Cut what they don't need to move forward

## 19. Write with Confidence

- Skip disclaimers like "this might seem obvious"
- If you're writing it, own it

## 20. Finish Strong

- End with a punch
- Summarize, challenge, or provoke thought
- Good endings stick
