# Engagement Post Templates

Proven viral-style post frameworks built for growth and interaction.

## Key Principles

### 1. Strong Hook
- Lead with a big claim or surprising insight
- Show social proof ("$6M in 3 weeks", "$31K made", "100k/day")
- Create immediate curiosity

### 2. Outcome-Driven Value
- Focus on the benefit: "plug-and-play templates", "full workflow", "no email needed"
- Make the end result clear and desirable
- Emphasize what they'll get, not what you did

### 3. Low Barrier to Entry
- No sign-up required
- No friction in the process
- "Just comment X and follow me"

### 4. Scarcity or Exclusivity (Optional)
- "Free for 24hrs"
- "Must be following so I can DM"
- "Only 50 spots available"

### 5. Built-in Virality
- Encourage: Like + Comment + Follow + Share
- Interaction feeds algorithmic boost
- Make engagement the gateway to value

### 6. Casual, Direct Tone
- No fluff. Straight to the point
- Conversational and non-salesy
- Confident but not arrogant

- Make it relevant to the content
- Easy to type and remember
- Consider using the benefit as the keyword ("WORKFLOW", "GUIDE")

### Formatting Best Practices
- Use bullet points for lists (increases readability)
- Add emojis sparingly for visual breaks
- Keep paragraphs to 1-2 sentences
- Use line breaks liberally

### Delivery Automation
- If you get lots of DMs, use a tool to automate delivery
- Consider DM automation bots for scale
- Have the resource ready before posting

### Promise Management
- Don't over-promise
- Keep delivery fast (within 24 hours)
- Make sure the resource actually delivers value
