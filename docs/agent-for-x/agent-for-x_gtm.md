# Agent for X — GTM Execution (v0)

## Positioning (draft)
- Promise: turn long-form ideas into x posts that sound like you.

## Pre-launch checklist
- [ ] Landing: waitlist + feature highlights + draft examples
- [ ] Instrument: visit → waitlist submit
- [ ] 5 before/after examples (raw note/transcript → drafted post/thread) (voice-preserving)
- [ ] 1 short demo video (10–20s) showing before/after
- [ ] Collect 20 pain quotes from creators about: voice going generic, consistency, time
- [ ] Reliability/polish checklist (avoid “quirks”)

## Experiments (first 3)
1) X: daily build-in-public posts showing before/after drafts (voice-preserving)
2) Creator forums (Reddit if accessible; otherwise HN/IndieHackers/communities): ask for beta testers + offer “draft 3 posts from your transcript”
3) Extension angle: "reply agent" demo clip + one workflow gif
